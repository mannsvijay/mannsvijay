- 👋 Hi, I’m @mannsvijay
- 👀 I’m interested in streetwear fashion, sneakers, graphic design, coding, and football.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microcontrollers, Analog & Digital Communication, and building Flickies — my own streetwear brand!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative design projects, front-end development, and cool fashion-tech fusions.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I collect rare Pokémon cards, love organizing events, and can probably name your sneakers just by looking at them.
